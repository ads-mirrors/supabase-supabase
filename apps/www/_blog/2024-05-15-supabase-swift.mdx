We are excited to announce that Supabase Swift libraries are now officially supported by Supabase.

This makes it simple to interact with Supabase from applications on Apple's platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "...")!
let anonKey = "public-anon-key"
let client = SupabaseClient(supabaseURL: url, supabaseKey: anonKey)

struct Country: Decodable {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
}

let countries: [Country] = try await supabase.from("countries")
  .select()
  .execute()
  .value
```
