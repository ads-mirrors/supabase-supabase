Today we're adding Dedicated Poolers - a Postgres connection pooler that's co-located with your database for maximum performance and reliability.

### Supabase Dedicated Pooler

The Dedicated Pooler is a [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) instance that's co-located with your Postgres database. This will require you to connect with IPv6 or, if that's not an option, you can use the [IPv4 add-on](/guides/platform/ipv4-address).

The dedicated pooler is isolated to your own project and grants you fine-grained control over the configuration.

### A problem of IP addresses

A year ago AWS [started charging for IPv4 addresses](/blog/ipv6). Only ~45% of the world have adopted IPv6, so this left us in a bit of a pickle: charge our customers more to cover the costs, or offer a proxy service that's compatible with IPv4.

We opted to release a free proxy service, [Supavisor](/blog/supavisor-postgres-connection-pooler), to keep our pricing as low as possible.

### A problem of growth

In the recent months, we've seen unprecedented growth. We have tens of thousands of new developers pouring into Supabase every week, doing weird and wonderful things with their databases.

This has added a lot of strain to the infrastructure in ways that are atypical of the past 4 years' usage.

### An alternative solution

Later this year we were planning to release dedicated connection poolers. We're pulling this timeline forward give you more options when managing your database. This gives you now 3 options for connecting to your database

![Pooling options](/images/blog/dedicated-poolers/connection-options.png)

1. **Direct connections (free):** recommended for when you are connecting using servers.
2. **Shared Pooler (free):** recommended for when you are connecting using serverless functions (like Next.js or AWS Lambda)
3. **Dedicated Pooler (Pro Plan and above):** recommended for when you are connecting using serverless functions and you start to scale up. It is available on the Pro Plan and above.
