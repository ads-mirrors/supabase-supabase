When you delete one or more object from a bucket, the files are permanently removed and not recoverable.
You can delete a single object or multiple objects at once.

<Admonition type="note">

It is important to note that deleting objects should always be done via the **Storage API** and NOT via a **SQL query**.
Deleting objects via a SQL query will not remove the object from the bucket and will result in the object being orphaned.

## Delete Objects

To delete one or more object, you can use the `remove` method.

```javascript
await supabase.storage.from('bucket').remove(['object-key-1', 'object-key-2'])
```

## RLS

In order to delete an object, the user must have the `delete` permission on the object.

Example policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "User can delete their own objects"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
    owner_id = auth.uid()
);
```
