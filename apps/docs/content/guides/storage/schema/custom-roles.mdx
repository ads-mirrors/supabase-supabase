In this guide you will learn how to create and use custom roles with Storage to manage access to objects and buckets for selective roles.

Supabase Storage uses the same role-based access control system as any other Supabase service using RLS (Row Level Security).

## Create a Custom Role

Let's create a custom role `manager` to provide full read-access to a specific bucket.
For a more advanced setup please refer to the [RBAC Guide](/docs/guides/auth/custom-claims-and-role-based-access-control-rbac#create-auth-hook-to-apply-user-role).

```sql
CREATE ROLE 'manager';

-- Important to grant the role to the authenticator and anon role
GRANT manager TO authenticator;
GRANT anon TO manager;
```

## Create a Policy

Let's create a policy that gives full read permissions to all objects in the bucket `teams` for the `manager` role.

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Manager can view all files in the bucket 'teams'"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO manager
USING (
 bucker_id = 'teams'
);
```

## Test the Policy

To impersonate the `manager` role, you will need a valid JWT token with the `manager` role.
You can quickly create one using the `jsonwebtoken` library in Node.js.

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

const JWT_SECRET = 'your-jwt-secret' // You can find this in your Supabase project settings under API
const USER_ID = '' // the user id that we want to give the manager role

const token = jwt.sign({ role: 'manager', sub: USER_ID }, JWT_SECRET, {
  expiresIn: '1h',
})
```

Now you can use this token to access the Storage API.

```js
const { StorageClient } = require('@supabase/storage-js')

const PROJECT_URL = 'https://your-project-id.supabase.co/storage/v1'

const storage = new StorageClient(PROJECT_URL, {
  authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
})

await storage.from('teams').list()
```
