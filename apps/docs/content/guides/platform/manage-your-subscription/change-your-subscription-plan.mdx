### Credits upon downgrade
Upon subscription downgrade, any prepaid subscription fee will be credited back to your organization for unused time in the billing cycle. These credits do not expire and will be applied to future invoices.

**Example:**
If you start a Pro Plan subscription on January 1 and downgrade to the Free Plan on January 15, your organization will receive approximately $12.50 in credits for the unused time between January 15 and January 31.

As stated in our [Terms of Service](https://supabase.com/terms#1-fees), we do not offer refunds to the payment method on file.
