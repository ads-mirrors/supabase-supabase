Organizations on a Free Plan can [pause](/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) and restore projects. This can be done to conserve resources for unused projects, or to upgrade a project to the latest version of each service.

<Admonition type="note">

Free projects are automatically paused after <SharedData data="config">pausing.free_tier</SharedData> of inactivity.

## Restoring a project

A backup is created when a project is paused. You can restore the backup from the dashboard within 90 days. After 90 days, you can download the backup file to manually restore or extract its data.

The 90-day window allows Supabase to introduce platform changes that may not be backwards compatible with older backups. Unlike active projects, static backups can't be updated to accommodate such changes.

### 90-day restore window

During the 90-day restore window, you can restore a paused project from [your project dashboard](/dashboard/projects).

### Post-restore window

After the 90-day restore window, you can download your project's backup file from the project dashboard. This backup is compatible with [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html). You can extract your data from it, or attempt to manually restore the project directly.

## Restoring projects when upgrading to a paid plan

If you upgrade to a paid plan while your project is paused, any expired one-click restore options are reenabled. Since the backup was taken outside the backwards compatibility window, it may fail to restore. If you have a problem restoring your backup after upgrading, contact [Support](/support).
