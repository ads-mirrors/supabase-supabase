## About billing on Supabase
Supabase bills separately for each organization. That means that each organization has its own subscription, including a unique plan (Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise), payment method, billing cycle, and invoices.

Different plans cannot be mixed within a single organization. For example, you cannot have both a Pro Plan project and a Free Plan project in the same organization. To have projects on different plans, you must create separate organizations. See [Project Transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer) if you need to move a project to a different organization.
