## About billing on Supabase
Supabase bills separately for each organization. That means that each organization has its own subscription, including a unique plan (Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise), payment method, billing cycle, and invoices.

Different plans cannot be mixed within a single organization. For example, you cannot have both a Pro Plan project and a Free Plan project in the same organization. To have projects on different plans, you must create separate organizations. See [Project Transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer) if you need to move a project to a different organization.

### Credits
Each organization has a credit balance. Credits are applied to future invoices to reduce the amount due. As long as the credit balance is greater than $0, credits will be used before charging your payment method on file.

Your organization gets [credits upon downgrade](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-subscription#credits-upon-downgrade). Besides that you can top up credits any time.

You can find the credit balance on the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).
