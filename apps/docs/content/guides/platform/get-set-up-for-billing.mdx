Correct billing settings are essential for ensuring successful payment processing and uninterrupted services. Additionally, it's important to configure all invoicing-related data early, as this information cannot be changed once an invoice is issued. Review these key points to ensure everything is set up correctly from the start.

## Payments

### Ensuring valid credit card details
Paid plans require a credit card to be on file. Ensure the correct credit card is set as active and

- has not expired
- has sufficient funds
- has a sufficient transaction limit

For more information on managing payment methods, see [Manage payment methods](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-subscription/manage-your-payment-information#manage-payment-methods).

### Alternatives to monthly charges
Instead of having your credit card charged every month, you can make an upfront payment by topping up your credit balance.

Why you may want to consider this option:
- you can avoid issues with recurring payments
- you have more control over how often your credit card is charged
- it might be easier for your accounting department
